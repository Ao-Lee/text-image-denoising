#### this is a U-net based image denoising solution which an U-net is trained as a pixel wise classifier. In prediction, the target image is cropped into small blocks which fit the network input.

#### Results: left column shows the target images, ground truth images are in the middle, the right column shows the prediction of the model

#### future work:
maybe also try auto encoder for image denoising???
